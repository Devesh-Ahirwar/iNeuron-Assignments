8. How do you "pretty print" dictionary values using which module and function?
Ans-
We can use in-built module called pretty-print module. This module is used whenever we want to print out the data structures dictionaries in a more formatted and presentable format.

Input:
import pprint


test_dict = {
    'serial_no': 65,
    'name': 'harry',
    'class_attended': [{ 'English', 'Mathematics', 'Science'}]
}

pretty = pprint.pprint(test_dict)

Output:
{'class_attended': ['English', 'Mathematics', 'Science'],
 'name': 'harry',
 'serial_no': 65}
