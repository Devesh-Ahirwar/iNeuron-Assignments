5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression
and a statement?
Ans-
In this example, we are assigning an integer value to variable spam thus here we are creating variable which is a statement.
An expression usually refers to a piece of code that can be evaluated to a value. For example: 1+10 or 5*9

6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans-
The value remain 22 as we are not assigning the value of 'bacon + 1' to bacon after evaluation

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Ans-
'spam' + 'spamspam' = 'spamspamspam'
'spam' * 3= 'spamspamspam'

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans- 
As we know variable is a symbol that stores data and variable has to start with a word it cannot start with a number. Though  variable can contain number at any position except the first one.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans-
Integer=int()
string=str()
floating point number=float()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans-
We cannot add string data type to integer data type vica versa. So have to change the data type of number 99 as string.
Right expression would be: 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
