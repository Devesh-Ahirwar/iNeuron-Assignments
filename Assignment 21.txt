1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.
from datetime import date

with open('today.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(str(date.today()))


2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string
with open('today.txt', 'r') as file:
    today_string = file.read()


3. Parse the date from today_string.
from datetime import datetime

today = datetime.strptime(today_string, '%Y-%m-%d').date()


4. List the files in your current directory
import os

files = os.listdir('.')
print(files)


5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).
import os

parent_dir = os.path.dirname(os.getcwd())
files = os.listdir(parent_dir)
print(files)


6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.
from multiprocessing import Process
from random import randint
from time import sleep
from datetime import datetime

def worker():
    sleep(randint(1, 5))
    print(datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for i in range(3):
        p = Process(target=worker)
        p.start()


7. Create a date object of your day of birth.
from datetime import date

my_birthday = date(2000, 1, 1)


8. What day of the week was your day of birth?
from datetime import date

my_birthday = date(2000, 1, 1)
weekday = my_birthday.strftime('%A')
print(weekday)


9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?
from datetime import date, timedelta

my_birthday = date(2000, 1, 1)
ten_thousand_days = my_birthday + timedelta(days=10000)
print(ten_thousand_days)
