1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans- Boolean data type values are:
True and False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans- AND, OR, NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operators truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate )
Ans-
AND
 A       B    Result
True   True   True
True   False  False
False  True   False
False  False  False

OR
 A       B    Result
True   True   True
True   False  True
False  True   True
False  False  False

NOT
 A     Result   
True   False  
False  True 


4. What are the values of the following expressions?
Ans-
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) || False
not (5 > 4) || False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) || True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) || False
(True and True) and (True == False) || False
(not False) or (not True) || True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans-
less than ( < ) 
less than or equal to ( <= ) 
greater than ( > ) 
greater than or equal to ( >= ) 
equal to ( == )
not equal to ( != )


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
Ans- Equal to is being denoted as '==' whereas assignment operator is denoted as '='
ex. A = 5 ; This assigns 5 as a value to variable A
A==5 ; This checks is the value of Variable A is equal to 5 or not and returns True or False

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
Ans-
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
{Indented block}print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
{Indented block}print('bacon')
else:
{Indented block}print('ham')
     print('spam')
print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans- 
if spam==1:
     print('Hello')
elif spam==2:
     print('Howdy')
else:
     print('Greetings')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Ans-
press CTRL + C on the keyboard

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans-
Break statement will end up the loop when gets triggered. 
While using the continue statement the loops do not terminate but continuously go on with the next iteration.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans-
range(10) - The iteration starts from 0 and goes till 9. The starting point will be 0 by default.
range(0, 10) - The iteration starts from 0 and goes till 9. The starting point is given as 0 in this.
range(0, 10, 1) - The iteration starts from 0 and goes till 9 but here the number takes 1st number from iteration point. If the number was two it will take every 2nd number from the iteration point.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(11):
          print(i)

i = 0          
while i<11:
      print(i)
      i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

import spam

spam.bacon()
