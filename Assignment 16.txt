1. Create a list called years_list, starting with the year of your birth, and each year thereafter until the year of your fifth birthday. For example, if you were born in 1980. the list would be years_list = [1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985].
Assuming the birth year is 1993, the list can be created as follows:
years_list = [1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998]


2. In which year in years_list was your third birthday? Remember, you were 0 years of age for your first year.
The third birthday would be in 1996. To calculate this, we can add 3 to the birth year, and then subtract 1 because the person is 0 years old in the first year:
years_list[3 - 1]


3.In the years list, which year were you the oldest?
The oldest year in the list would be the last year in the list:
years_list[-1]


4. Make a list called things with these three strings as elements: "mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella".
We can create the list things as follows:
things = ["mozzarella", "cinderella", "salmonella"]


5. Capitalize the element in things that refers to a person and then print the list. Did it change the element in the list?
things[1] = things[1].title()
print(things)


6. Make a surprise list with the elements "Groucho," "Chico," and "Harpo."
We can create the surprise list as follows:
surprise = ["Groucho", "Chico", "Harpo"]


7. Lowercase the last element of the surprise list, reverse it, and then capitalize it.
To lowercase the last element of the surprise list, reverse it, and then capitalize it, we can chain the lower(), reverse(), and capitalize() methods:
surprise[-1] = surprise[-1].lower()[::-1].capitalize()
print(surprise)


8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it. Here are your starter words: dog is chien, cat is chat, and walrus is morse.
We can create the dictionary e2f as follows:
e2f = {'dog': 'chien', 'cat': 'chat', 'walrus': 'morse'}
print(e2f)


9. Write the French word for walrus in your three-word dictionary e2f.
The French word for walrus in e2f is 'morse', which we already included in the dictionary.


10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.
We can create the f2e dictionary from e2f using the items() method and a dictionary comprehension:
f2e = {v: k for k, v in e2f.items()}
print(f2e)


11. Print the English version of the French word chien using f2e.
To print the English version of the French word 'chien', we can simply use the key lookup with f2e:
print(f2e['chien'])


12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in e2f.
We can create a set of English words from the keys in e2f using the set() function:
english_words = set(e2f.keys())
print(english_words)


13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys: 'animals', 'plants', and 'other'. Make the 'animals' key refer to another dictionary with the keys 'cats', 'octopi', and 'emus'. Make the 'cats' key refer to a list of strings with the values 'Henri', 'Grumpy', and 'Lucy'. Make all the other keys refer to empty dictionaries.
We can create the life dictionary as follows:
life = {
    'animals': {
        'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'],
        'octopi': {},
        'emus': {}
    },
    'plants': {},
    'other': {}
}


14. Print the top-level keys of life.
To print the top-level keys of life, you can use the keys() method:
print(life['animals'].keys())


15. Print the keys for life['animals'].
To print the keys for life['animals'], you can use the keys() method again, but this time on life['animals']:
print(life['animals'].keys())


16. Print the values for life['animals']['cats']
To print the values for life['animals']['cats'], you can simply print the value associated with the 'cats' key:
print(life['animals']['cats'])
